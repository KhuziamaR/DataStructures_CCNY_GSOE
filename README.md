# DataStructures_CCNY_GSOE

Hello! 
This project was assigned to me from my Data Structures course at CCNY! 

The goal is to Define a C++ class named "Statistican" and implement these features:
1) Class Constructor
2) overloaded operator + 
3) overloaded operator * 
4) overloaded operator == 
5) many methods that allow us to manipulate and access the data in the statistican class! 

The outcomes of this project was that i helped solidify my conceptual knowledge of OOP.
This was a exciting project as it established the start of our journey to become amazing
programmers that have solid knowledge on the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming in C++ :)
